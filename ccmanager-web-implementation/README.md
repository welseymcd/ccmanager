# CCManager Web Implementation Guide

This directory contains atomic, test-driven implementation steps for the CCManager Web Interface. Each subdirectory represents a major component with its own tests and implementation details.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
1. [01-infrastructure/](01-infrastructure/) - Basic server setup and project structure
2. [02-websocket-protocol/](02-websocket-protocol/) - WebSocket communication layer
3. [08-testing/](08-testing/) - Test framework setup

### Phase 2: Backend Services (Week 3-4)
4. [03-session-management/](03-session-management/) - PTY session lifecycle
5. [06-persistence/](06-persistence/) - SQLite database and session history
6. [05-authentication/](05-authentication/) - Auth system and API key management

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Week 5-6)
7. [07-frontend/](07-frontend/) - React app with terminal tabs
8. [04-terminal-tabs/](04-terminal-tabs/) - Tab management and xterm.js integration

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Week 7)
9. [09-deployment/](09-deployment/) - Docker, monitoring, and production setup

## Test-First Approach

Each component follows this pattern:
1. Write failing tests
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor for production quality
4. Add monitoring and logging
5. Document rollback procedures

## Success Metrics

- All tests passing with >80% coverage
- WebSocket latency <100ms
- Support for 20+ concurrent sessions
- Zero data loss during disconnections
- Successful session recovery after server restart
